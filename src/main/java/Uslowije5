How much would you like to earn at Spartez?

"Open Company - No Bullshit" is the value we really live up to. We hate wrapping around the bush and wasting your and our time, should it turn out that we cannot afford you. So, honestly and upfront, we are asking you about your financial expectations. As our salary bands are quite wide and there are often different levels for a position (junior, mid, senior, principal) knowing how you rate yourself and how it impacts your financial expectations will only help us better handle your recruitment process.

You don't need to provide the exact number. It could be some rough range (and possibly a comment). Don't be afraid that you put yourself into a box with a glass ceiling. There are people at Spartez who were offered more than they expected. If you don't know the job market (and IT salaries) in Poland, then feel free to tell us about it. In this case, indicate rather which seniority level you consider youself to represent.

Remember to tell us whether you have in mind gross or net salary.
