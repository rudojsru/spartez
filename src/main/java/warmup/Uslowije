Task time
You have 120 minutes for this task so you may experiment with the tool, set up your IDE, resolve any connectivity problems etc.
The actual coding part of this task is meant to require at most 10 minutes to finish.

Highest value index
Implement the warmup.MyWarmup.findMax(int[] array) method that returns the position of the highest value in the array, or -1 if the array is empty.
If the highest value occurs more than once, return the position of it's first occurence in the array.

Sample Input:

[1,2,3,0,-1] should return 2.
[1,2,2,1] should return 1.
[] should return -1.
Your solution must be implemented in the existing warmup.MyWarmup class implementing the Warmup interface.
You can add tests to the MyWarmupTest class and Build the project to self-assess your solution.
