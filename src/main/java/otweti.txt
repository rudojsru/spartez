**Revolut application**, which provide Revolut account and payment card, which is connected with Your bank and allows to pay for transactions wihout fee. It's a breakthough in the banking sector.
This application is the current best banking product, for pivate and travelling matters. Those, who travel, thanks to Revolut are safer and mobile (in terms of money) when abroad. The exchange rate of the Revolut account is the best one and compete with Visa systems. 
If i were to talk to the makers, i would advice to increase the range of services provided. E.g. provide small credit (in cae of emergency) as looking at Your user story. It means, if You are heavy user of the Revolut, they might intoduce some trust system. 



Being a passionate Java junior, i appreiate experience and possbility to work on interesting product, which covers some needs of higher level. Some amount of money, which covers a bit above my basic needs, will work.

This product is Lime - electric kickboards, based on the sharing economy principle: You pick one (according to the map in the mobile app) and pay for time, spent while riding. What attracts me is the user experience in the product. Starting from the application uploading and ending with the dropping the kickboard at any location (in the range of the established city/town location). Kickboards as such were popular for some longer time: Swiss businemssmen used them to get to work. However, more popularity among the citizens of big cities they've agained with the increase of the environment-friendly transport + boost of the active lifestyle. What i like like in Lime kickboards is that they provide with some speed and time spending, where you were supposed just to walk.
