Find Array
Implement the findarray.MyFindArray.findArray(int[] array, int[] subArray) method that returns the starting position of the last occurence of the subArray within the array, or -1 if the subArray cannot be found.

Sample Input:

[4,3,3,7,8] and [3,7] should return 2.
[1,3,5] and [1] should return 0.
[7,8,9] and [8,9,10] should return -1.
[0,0,3,7,0,3,7,0] and [3,7] should return 5.
Your solution must be implemented in the existing findarray.MyFindArray class implementing the FindArray interface.
You can add tests to the MyFindArrayTest class and Build the project to self-assess your solution.
